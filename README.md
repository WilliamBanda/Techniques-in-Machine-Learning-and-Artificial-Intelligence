# Deep Learning and Computer Vision Project
Welcome to this project repository! The goal of this project is to explore and apply Deep Learning and computer vision concepts. The project involves conceiving, designing, training, evaluating, and presenting the results of a unique project.

# Project Scope
In this project we take on a novel training dataset that we have curated.

# Project Outputs
The project outputs will include a fully reproducible workflow, which means that all the code and data used is made available through a public Github repository specifically in this GitHub account. Additionally, this repo has a Google Colab Notebook that documents the project's inception, progress, code, and relevant outputs. The notebook also includes a comprehensive summary of the results obtained.

# Repository Structure
To facilitate easy navigation and understanding of this project, the repository is organized as follows:
data/: This directory contains the curated training dataset and the data collected from Roboflow.
notebooks/: This directory contains a Google Colab Notebook that provides a detailed breakdown of the project. It includes explanations, code snippets, visualizations, and analysis of the results.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions for setting up and running the code.

# Usage
To replicate and explore this project, please follow the steps below:
Clone this repository to your local machine using the command git clone https://github.com/WilliamBanda/Techniques-in-Machine-Learning-and-Artificial-Intelligence.git

# Navigate to the project directory using cd repository-name.
Set up the required Python environment by installing the necessary dependencies listed in requirements.txt. You can do this using a virtual environment or any other package manager of your choice.
Once the environment is set up, launch the Google Colab Notebook in the notebooks/ directory. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code and generate results.
Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to adapt it to your specific needs or extend the project further.
