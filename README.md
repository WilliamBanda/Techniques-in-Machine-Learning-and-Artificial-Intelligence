# Deep Learning and Computer Vision Project
Welcome to this project repository! The goal of this project is to explore and apply Deep Learning and computer vision concepts. The project involves conceiving, designing, training, evaluating, and presenting the results of a unique project.

# Project Scope
In this project, we aim to evaluate and compare the accuracy, precision, and recall of the YOLOv8 model in classifying fruits across two distinct datasets. One dataset comprises images captured using a poor-quality camera, while the other consists of high-quality images obtained online. This comparative analysis aims to elucidate the impact of image quality on the model's performance, particularly in the context of fruit classification under diverse imaging conditions, including those prevalent in developing countries.

# Project Outputs
The project outputs will include a fully reproducible workflow, which means that all the code and data used is made available through a public Github repository specifically in this GitHub account. Additionally, this repo has a Google Colab Notebook that documents the project's inception, progress, code, and relevant outputs. The notebook also includes a comprehensive summary of the results obtained.

# Repository Structure
To facilitate easy navigation and understanding of this project, the repository is organized as follows:
- data/: This directory contains the curated training dataset and the data collected from Roboflow.
- notebooks/: This directory contains a Google Colab Notebook that provides a detailed breakdown of the project. It includes explanations, code snippets, visualizations, and analysis of the results.
- README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions for setting up and running the code.

# Usage
To replicate and explore this project, please follow the steps below:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command git clone https://github.com/WilliamBanda/Techniques-in-Machine-Learning-and-Artificial-Intelligence.git
